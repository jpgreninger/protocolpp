<div class="textblock"><p>See IETF <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-nir-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305-01.pdf">https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-nir-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305-01.pdf</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="AEAD"></a>
ChaCha20 and Poly1305 for IETF protocols</h1>
<p>This document defines the ChaCha20 stream cipher, as well as the use of the Poly1305 authenticator, both as stand-alone algorithms, and as a "combined mode", or Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) algorithm.</p>
<p><b>AEAD Construction</b></p>
<p>Note: Much of the content of this document, including this AEAD construction is taken from Adam Langley’s draft ([ agl-draft ]) for the use of these algorithms in TLS. The AEAD construction described here is called AEAD_CHACHA20-POLY1305</p>
<p>AEAD_CHACHA20-POLY1305 is an authenticated encryption with additional data algorithm. The inputs to AEAD_CHACHA20-POLY1305 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 256-bit key</li>
<li>A 96-bit nonce - different for each invocation with the same key.</li>
<li>An arbitrary length plaintext</li>
<li>Arbitrary length additional data</li>
</ul>
<p>The ChaCha20 and Poly1305 primitives are combined into an AEAD that takes a 256-bit key and 64-bit IV as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First the 96-bit nonce is constructed by prepending a 32-bit constant value to the IV. This could be set to zero, or could be derived from keying material, or could be assigned to a sender. It is up to the specific protocol to define the source for that 32-bit value</li>
<li>Next, a Poly1305 one-time key is generated from the 256-bit key and nonce using the procedure described in Section 2.6</li>
<li>The ChaCha20 encryption function is called to encrypt the plaintext, using the same key and nonce, and with the initial counter set to 1</li>
<li>The Poly1305 function is called with the Poly1305 key calculated above, and a message constructed as a concatenation of the following:</li>
<li>The additional data</li>
<li>The length of the additional data in octets (as a 64-bit little-endian integer). TBD: bit count rather than octets? network order?</li>
<li>The ciphertext</li>
<li>The length of the ciphertext in octets (as a 64-bit little- endian integer). TBD: bit count rather than octets? network order?</li>
</ul>
<p>Decryption is pretty much the same thing</p>
<p>The output from the AEAD is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ciphertext of the same length as the plaintext</li>
<li>A 128-bit tag, which is the output of the Poly1305 function</li>
</ul>
<p>A few notes about this design:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The amount of encrypted data possible in a single invocation is <img class="formulaInl" alt="${2}^{32}-1$" src="form_0.png"/> blocks of 64 bytes each, for a total of 247,877,906,880 bytes, or nearly 256 GB. This should be enough for traffic protocols such as IPsec and TLS, but may be too small for file and/or disk encryption. For such uses, we can return to the original design, reduce the nonce to 64 bits, and use the integer at position 13 as the top 32 bits of a 64-bit block counter, increasing the total message size to over a million petabytes (1,180,591,620,717,411,303,360 bytes to be exact)</li>
<li>Despite the previous item, the ciphertext length field in the construction of the buffer on which Poly1305 runs limits the ciphertext (and hence, the plaintext) size to <img class="formulaInl" alt="${2}^{64}$" src="form_1.png"/> bytes, or sixteen thousand petabytes (18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes to be exact)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Implementation Advice</b></p>
<p>Each block of ChaCha20 involves 16 move operations and one increment operation for loading the state, 80 each of XOR, addition and Roll operations for the rounds, 16 more add operations and 16 XOR operations for protecting the plaintext <br  />
</p>
<p>Section 2.3 describes the ChaCha block function as "adding the original
 input words". This implies that before starting the rounds on the ChaCha state, it is copied aside only to be added in later. This would be correct, but it saves a few operations to instead copy the state and do the work on the copy. This way, for the next block you don’t need to recreate the state, but only to increment the block counter. This saves approximately 5.5% of the cycles</p>
<p>It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use a generic big number library such as the one in OpenSSL for the arithmetic operations in Poly1305. Such libraries use dynamic allocation to be able to handle any-sized integer, but that flexibility comes at the expense of performance as well as side-channel security. More efficient implementations that run in constant time are available, one of them in DJB’s own library, NaCl ([ NaCl ]).</p>
<p><b>Security Considerations</b></p>
<p>The ChaCha20 cipher is designed to provide 256-bit security. The Poly1305 authenticator is designed to ensure that forged messages are rejected with a probability of <img class="formulaInl" alt="$1-(\frac{n}{{2}^{102}})$" src="form_2.png"/> for a 16n-byte message, even after sending <img class="formulaInl" alt="${2}^{64}$" src="form_1.png"/> legitimate messages, so it is SUF-CMA in the terminology of [ AE ].</p>
<p>Proving the security of either of these is beyond the scope of this document. Such proofs are available in the referenced academic papers. The most important security consideration in implementing this draft is the uniqueness of the nonce used in ChaCha20. Counters and LFSRs are both acceptable ways of generating unique nonces, as is encrypting a counter using a 64-bit cipher such as DES. Note that it is not acceptable to use a truncation of a counter encrypted with a 128-bit or 256-bit cipher, because such a truncation may repeat after a short time</p>
<p>The Poly1305 key MUST be unpredictable to an attacker. Randomly generating the key would fulfill this requirement, except that Poly1305 is often used in communications protocols, so the receiver should know the key. Pseudo-random number generation such as by encrypting a counter is acceptable. Using ChaCha with a secret key and a nonce is also acceptable</p>
<p>The algorithms presented here were designed to be easy to implement in constant time to avoid side-channel vulnerabilities. The operations used in ChaCha20 are all additions, XORs, and fixed rotations. All of these can and should be implemented in constant time. Access to offsets into the ChaCha state and the number of operations do not depend on any property of the key, eliminating the chance of information about the key leaking through the timing of cache misses</p>
<p>For Poly1305, the operations are addition, multiplication and modulus, all on &gt;128-bit numbers. This can be done in constant time, but a naive implementation (such as using some generic big number library) will not be constant time. For example, if the multiplication is performed as a separate operation from the modulus, the result will some times be under <img class="formulaInl" alt="${2}^{256}$" src="form_3.png"/> and some times be above <img class="formulaInl" alt="$2^256$" src="form_4.png"/>. Implementers should be careful about timing side-channels for Poly1305 by using the appropriate implementation of these operations</p>
