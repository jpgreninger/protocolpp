MACsec Security Association</h1>
<p>Information provided by IEEE <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.1AE-2006.pdf">https://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.1AE-2006.pdf</a></p>
<p><b>Encoding of MACsec protocol data units</b></p>
<p>This clause specifies the structure and encoding of the MACsec Protocol Data Units (MPDUs) exchanged between MAC Security Entities (SecYs). It</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifies rules for the representation and encoding of protocol fields</li>
<li>Specifies the major components of each MPDU, and the fields they comprise</li>
<li>Reviews the purpose of each field, and the functionality provided</li>
<li>Specifies validation of the MPDU on reception</li>
<li>Documents the allocation of an EtherType value, the MACsec EtherType, to identify MPDUs</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE—The MPDU validation checks specified in this clause are deliberately limited to ensuring successful decoding, and do not overlap with the specification of SecY operation (Clause 10).</p>
<p><b>Structure, representation, and encoding</b></p>
<p>All MPDUs shall contain an integral number of octets. The octets in a MPDU are numbered starting from 1 and increasing in the order they are put into the MAC Service Data Unit (MSDU) that accompanies a request to or indication from the instance of the MAC Internal Sublayer Service (ISS) used by a SecY. The bits in an octet are numbered from 1 to 8 in order of increasing bit significance, where 1 is the least significant bit in the octet. Where octets and bits within a MPDU are represented using a diagram, octets shown higher on the page than subsequent octets and octets shown to the left of subsequent octets at the same height on the page are lower numbered, bits shown to the left of other bits within the same octet are higher numbered. Where two or more consecutive octets are represented as hexadecimal values, lower numbered octet(s) are shown to the left and each octet following the first is preceded by a hyphen, e.g., 01-80-C2-00-00-00.</p>
<p>When consecutive octets are used to encode a binary number, the lower octet number has the more significant value. When consecutive bits within an octet are used to encode a binary number, the higher bit number has the most significant value. When bits within consecutive octets are used to encode a binary number, the lower octet number composes the more significant bits of the number. A flag is encoded as a single bit, and is set (True) if the bit takes the value 1, and clear (False) otherwise. The remaining bits within the octet can be used to encode other protocol fields.</p>

Macsec Packet Structure</div></div>
<p><b>Major components</b></p>
<p>Each MPDU comprises</p>
<ul>
<li>A Security TAG (SecTAG)</li>
<li>Secure Data (9.10) c) An Integrity Check Value (ICV)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these components comprises an integral number of octets and is encoded in successive octets of the MPDU as illustrated in Figure 9-1</p>
<p>NOTE—The MPDU does not include the source and destination MAC addresses, as these are separate parameters of the service requests and indications to and from the insecure service that supports MACsec</p>

<p><b>TAG Control Information (TCI)</b></p>
<p>The TCI field comprises bits 8 through 3 of octet 3 (Figure 9-4) of the SecTAG. These bits facilitate</p>
<ul>
<li>Version numbering of the MACsec protocol without changing the MACsec EtherType</li>
<li>Optional use of the MAC Source Address parameter to convey the SCI</li>
<li>Optional inclusion of an explicitly encoded SCI (7.1.2, Figure 7-7)</li>
<li>Use of the EPON (Clause 12) Single Copy Broadcast capability, without requiring an explicit SCI to distinguish the SCB Secure Channel</li>
<li>Extraction of the User Data from MPDUs by systems that do not possess the SAK (8.1.2, 8.1.4) when confidentiality is not being provided</li>
<li>Determination of whether confidentiality or integrity alone are in use</li>
</ul>
<p>The encoding of the MACsec TCI in the MPDU is illustrated in Figure 9-4.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="MacSec_TCIAN.png" alt="MacSec_TCIAN.png"/>
<div class="caption">
TAG Control Information for the Macsec Packet</div></div>
<p>TCIAN bit encoding is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The version number shall be 0 and is encoded in bit 8. NOTE—Future versions of the MACsec protocol may use additional bits of the TCI to encode the version number. The fields and format of the remainder of the MPDU may change if the version number changes</li>
<li>If the MPDU is transmitted by an end station and the first 6 octets of the SCI are equal to the value of the octets of MAC Source Address parameter of the ISS request in canonical format order, bit 7 [the End Station (ES) bit] of the TCI may be set</li>
<li>If the ES bit is set, bit 6 (the SC bit) shall not be set and an SCI shall not be explicitly encoded in the SecTAG. The ES bit is clear if the Source Address is not used to determine the SCI. If an SCI (9.9, 7.1.2) is explicitly encoded in the SecTAG, bit 6 (the SC bit) of the TCI shall be set. The SC bit shall be clear if an SCI is not present in the SecTAG</li>
<li>If and only if the MPDU is associated with the Secure Channel that supports the EPON Single Copy Broadcast capability, bit 5 (the SCB bit) of the TCI may be set</li>
<li>If the SCB is set, bit 6 (the SC bit) shall not be set and an SCI shall not be explicitly included in the SecTAG. If the ES bit is set and the SCB is not set, the SCI comprises a Port Identifier (7.1.2) component of 00-01. If the SCB bit is set, the Port Identifier (7.1.2) component has the reserved SCB value of 00-00</li>
<li>If the Encryption (E) bit is set and the Changed Text (C) bit is clear, the frame is not processed by the SecY (10.6) but is reserved for use by the KaY. Otherwise, the E bit is set if and only if confidentiality is being provided and is clear if integrity only is being provided</li>
<li>The C bit is clear if and only if the Secure Data is exactly the same as the User Data and the ICV is 16 octets long. When the Default Cipher Suite (14.5) is used for integrity protection only, the Secure Data is the unmodified User Data, and a 16 octet ICV is used. Both the E bit and the C bit are therefore clear, and the data conveyed by MACsec is available to applications, such as network management, that need to see the data but are not trusted with the SAK that would permit its modification. Other Cipher Suites may also integrity protect data without modifying it, and use a 16 octet ICV, enabling read access to the data by other applications. The E and C bits are also clear for such Cipher Suites when integrity only is provided</li>
<li>Some cryptographic algorithms modify or add to the data even when integrity only is being provided, or use an ICV that is not 16 octets long. The C bit is never clear for such an algorithm, even if the E bit is clear to indicate that confidentiality is not provided. Recovery of the data from a MACsec frame with the E bit clear and the C bit set requires knowledge of the Cipher Suite at a minimum. That information is not provided in the MACsec frame. If both the C bit and E bit are set, confidentiality of the original User Data is being provided.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Association Number (AN)</b></p>
<p>The AN is encoded as an integer in bits 1 and 2 of octet 3 of the SecTAG (Figure 9-4) and identifies up to four different SAs within the context of an SC. NOTE—Although each receiving SecY only needs to maintain two SAs per SC, the use of a 2-bit AN simplifies the design of protocols that update values associated with each of the SAs.</p>
<p><b>Short Length (SL)</b></p>
<p>SL is an integer encoded in bits 1 through 6 of octet 4 of the SecTAG and is set to the number of octets in the Secure Data (9.10) field, i.e., the number of octets between the last octet of the SecTAG and the first octet of the ICV, if that number is less than 48. Otherwise, SL is set to zero. If the number is zero then the frame is deemed not to have been short. The Secure Data field always comprises at least one octet. Bits 7 and 8 of octet 4 shall be zero.</p>
<p><b>Packet Number (PN)</b></p>
<p>The PN is encoded in octets 5 through 8 of the SecTAG to</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a unique IV PDU for all MPDUs transmitted using the same SA</li>
<li>Support replay protection</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE—As specified in this clause, the IV used by the default Cipher Suite (GCM-AES-128) comprises the SCI (even if the SCI is not transmitted in the SecTAG) and the PN. Subject to proper unique MAC Address allocation procedures, the SCI is a globally unique identifier for a SecY. To satisfy the IV uniqueness requirements of CTR mode of operation, a fresh key is used before PN values are reused.</p>
<p><b>Secure Channel Identifier (SCI)</b></p>
<p>If the SC bit in the TCI is set, the SCI (7.1.2, 8.2.1) is encoded in octets 9 through 16 of the SecTAG, and facilitates</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of the SA where the CA comprises three or more peers</li>
<li>Network management identification of the SecY that has transmitted the frame Octets 9 through 14 of the SecTAG encode the System Identifier component of the SCI. This comprises the six octets of a globally unique MAC address uniquely associated with the transmitting SecY. The octet values and their sequence conform to the Canonical Format specified by IEEE Std 802. Octets 15 and 16 of the SecTAG encode the Port Identifier component of the SCI, as an integer.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE —The 64-bit value FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF is never used as an SCI and is reserved for use by implementations to indicate the absence of an SC or an SCI in contexts where an SC can be present.</p>
<p>An explicitly encoded SCI field in the SecTAG is not required on point-to-point links, which are identified by the operPointToPointMAC status parameter of the service provider. In the point-to-point case, the secure association created by the SecY for the peer SecYs, together with the direction of transmission of the secured MPDU, can be used to identify the transmitting SecY and therefore an explicitly encoded SCI is unnecessary. Although the SCI does not have to be repeated in each frame when only two SecYs participate in a CA (see Clause 8, Clause9, and Clause10), the SCI still forms part of the cryptographic computation.</p>
<p><b>802.1Q VLAN Tagging</b></p>
<p>Tagging a frame with a VLAN tag</p>
<p>a. Allows a VID to be conveyed, facilitating consistent VLAN classification of the frame throughout the network and enabling segregation of frames assigned to different VIDs</p>
<p>b. Allows priority (IEEE Std 802.1AC, 6.8) to be conveyed with the frame when using IEEE 802 LAN media access control methods that provide no inherent capability to signal priority</p>
<p><b>Tag Format</b></p>
<p>Each tag comprises the following sequential information elements:</p>
<p>a. A Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID)</p>
<p>b. Tag Control Information (TCI) that is dependent on the tag type</p>
<p>c. Additional information, if and as required by the tag type and TCI</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="VLAN802.1QTag.png" alt="VLAN802.1QTag.png"/>
<div class="caption">
VLAN Tag Format</div></div>
<p>The tag encoding function supports each EISS (6.8) instance by using an instance of the ISS to transmit and receive frames and encodes the above information in the first and subsequent octets of the MSDU that will accompany an ISS M_UNITDATA.request, immediately prior to encoding the sequence of octets that constitute the corresponding EISS M_UNITDATA.request’s MSDU. On reception the tag decoding function is selected by the TPID and decodes the TCI and additional information octets (if present) prior to issuing an EISS M_UNITDATA.indication with an MSDU that comprises the subsequent octets</p>
<p>The following types of tags are specified:</p>
<p>a. A C-TAG, for general use by C-VLAN Bridges and C-VLAN components of Provider Edge Bridges</p>
<p>b. An S-TAG, reserved for use by S-VLAN Bridges, the S-VLAN component of Provider Edge Bridges and BEBs, and C-VLAN Bridges signaling priority to a PBN or a PBBN</p>
<p>c. An I-TAG, reserved for use by BEBs</p>
<p>NOTE—The S-TAG is identical to the B-TAG</p>
<p>A distinct EtherType has been allocated (see table below) for use in the TPID field of each tag type so they can be distinguished from each other, and from other protocols</p>

<p>The VID is encoded in a 12-bit field. A VLAN Bride may not support the full range of VID values but shall support the use of all VID values in the range 0 through a maximum N, less than or equal to 4094 and specified for that implementation. The following table identifies VID values that have specific meanings or uses</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="VLAN_Reserved_VID_values.png" alt="VLAN_Reserved_VID_values.png"/>
<div class="caption">
Reserved VID values SA</div></div>
<p>NOTE 1 - There is a distinction between the range of VIDs that an implementation can support and the maximum number of active VIDs supported at any one time. An implementation supports only 16 active VIDs, for example, may use VIDs chosen from anywhere in the identifier space, or from a limited range. The latter can result in difficulties where different Bridges in the same network support different maximums. It is recommended that new implementations of this standard support the full range of VIDs, even if the number of active VIDs is limited</p>
<p>The priority and drop eligible parameters are conveyed in the 3-bit PCP field and the DEI field</p>
<p>NOTE 2 - Previous versions of this standard used bit 5 of octet 1 of the TCI in C-TAGs as a Canonical Format Indicator (CFI). Bridges conformant to this version of the standard will not interoperate with Bridges that set the CFI as a result of inserting C-TAGs in frames received from an IEEE 802.5 Token Ring LAN. Bridges conformant to this version of the standard will interoperate with Bridges that forward bit 5 of octet 1 as a CFI but do not 802.5 Token Ring interfaces</p>
<p><b>Support for double tags</b></p>
<p>When using a single VLAN tag, the tag in the security association name VLANTAG1 will be used. If a second tag is used, the tag in the security association named VLANTAG2 will be inserted between VLANTAG1 and the EthType of the packet as shown below</p>
