Abstract

This  Standard  specifies  the  Secure  Hash  Algorithm-3  (SHA-3)  family  of  functions  on
binary  data.  Each  of  the  SHA-3  functions  is  based  on  an  instance  of  the  KECCAK
algorithm that NIST selected as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm
Competition.  This  Standard  also  specifies  the  KECCAK-p  family  of  mathematical
permutations, including the permutation that underlies KECCAK, in order to facilitate the
development of additional permutation-based cryptographic functions.

The  SHA-3  family  consists  of  four  cryptographic  hash  functions,  called  SHA3-224,
SHA3-256,  SHA3-384,  and  SHA3-512,  and  two  extendable-output  functions  (XOFs),
called SHAKE128 and SHAKE256.

Hash  functions  are  components  for  many  important  information  security  applications,
including 1) the generation and verification of digital signatures, 2) key derivation, and 3)
pseudorandom  bit generation.  The  hash  functions  specified in  this Standard supplement
the  SHA-1  hash  function  and  the  SHA-2  family  of  hash  functions  that  are  specified  in
FIPS 180-4, the Secure Hash Standard.

Extendable-output  functions  are  different  from  hash  functions,  but  it  is  possible  to  use
them  in  similar  ways,  with  the  flexibility  to  be  adapted  directly  to  the  requirements  of
individual applications, subject to additional security considerations.

Announcing the

SHA-3 STANDARD:  PERMUTATION-BASED HASH
AND EXTENDABLE OUTPUT FUNCTIONS

Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National
Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  after  approval  by  the  Secretary  of  Commerce
pursuant  to  Section  5131  of  the  Information  Technology  Management  Reform  Act  of  1996
(Public Law 104-106), and the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235).

1. Name  of  Standard:  SHA-3  Standard:  Permutation-Based  Hash  and  Extendable-Output
Functions (FIPS PUB 202).

2. Category of Standard: Computer Security Standard, Cryptography.

3. Explanation:  This  Standard  (FIPS  202)  specifies  the  Secure  Hash  Algorithm-3  (SHA-3)
family of functions on binary data. Each of the SHA-3 functions is based on an instance of the
KECCAK  algorithm  that  NIST  selected  as  the  winner  of  the  SHA-3  Cryptographic  Hash
Algorithm  Competition.  This  Standard  also  specifies  the  KECCAK-p  family  of  mathematical
permutations,  including  the  permutation  that  underlies  KECCAK,  which  can  serve  as  the  main
components of additional cryptographic functions that may be specified in the future.

The  SHA-3  family  consists  of  four  cryptographic  hash  functions  and  two  extendable-output
functions  (XOFs).  The  cryptographic  hash  functions  are  called  SHA3-224,  SHA3-256,  SHA3-
384, and SHA3-512; and the XOFs are called SHAKE128 and SHAKE256.

For hash functions, the input is called the message, and the output is called the (message) digest
or  the  hash  value.  The  length  of  the  message  can  vary;  the  length  of  the  digest  is  fixed.  A
cryptographic  hash  function  is  a  hash  function  that  is  designed  to  provide  special  properties,
including collision resistance and preimage resistance, that are  important for many applications
in  information  security.  For  example,  a  cryptographic  hash  function  increases  the  security  and
efficiency of a digital signature scheme when the digest is digitally signed instead of the message
itself.  In  this  context,  the  collision  resistance  of  the  hash  function  provides  assurance  that  the
original message could  not have been  altered to a different message with the same hash value,
and  hence,  the  same  signature.  Other  applications  of  cryptographic  hash  functions  include
pseudorandom bit generation, message authentication codes, and key derivation functions.

iv

The four SHA-3 hash functions specified in this Standard supplement the hash functions that are
specified  in  FIPS  180-4  [1]:  SHA-1  and  the  SHA-2  family.  Together,  both  Standards  provide
resilience against future advances in hash function analysis, because they rely on fundamentally
different  design  principles.  In  addition  to  design  diversity,  the  hash  functions  in  this  Standard
provide some complementary implementation  and performance characteristics to those in  FIPS
180-4.

For  XOFs,  the  length  of  the  output  can  be  chosen  to  meet  the  requirements  of  individual
applications.  The  XOFs  can  be  specialized  to  hash  functions,  subject  to  additional  security
considerations,  or  used  in  a  variety  of  other  applications.  The  approved  uses  of  XOFs  will  be
specified in NIST Special Publications.

The KECCAK-p permutations were designed to be suitable as the main components for a variety
of cryptographic functions, including keyed functions for authentication and/or encryption. The
six  SHA-3  functions  can  be  considered  as  modes  of  operation  (modes)  of  the  KECCAK-
p[1600,24] permutation. In the future, additional modes of this permutation or other KECCAK-p
permutations  may  be  specified  and  approved  in  FIPS  publications  or  in  NIST  Special
Publications.

1  INTRODUCTION

This Standard specifies a new family of functions that supplement SHA-1 and the SHA-2 family
of  hash  functions  specified  in  FIPS  180-4  [1].  This  family,  called  SHA-3  (Secure  Hash
Algorithm-3), is based on KECCAK [2]—the algorithm1 that NIST selected as the winner of the
public  SHA-3  Cryptographic  Hash  Algorithm  Competition  [3].  The  SHA-3  family  consists  of
four  cryptographic  hash  functions  and  two  extendable-output  functions.  These  six  functions
share the structure that is described in [4], namely, the sponge construction; functions with this
structure are called sponge functions.

A hash function is a function on binary data (i.e., bit strings) for which the length of the output is
fixed.2 The input to a hash function is called the message, and the output is called the (message)
digest or hash value. The digest often serves as a condensed representation of the message. The
four  SHA-3  hash  functions  are  named  SHA3-224,  SHA3-256,  SHA3-384,  and  SHA3-512;  in
each  case,  the  suffix  after  the  dash  indicates  the  fixed  length  of  the  digest,  e.g.,  SHA3-256
produces  256-bit  digests.  The  SHA-2  functions, i.e.,  SHA-224,  SHA-256,  SHA-384  SHA-512,
SHA-512/224,  and  SHA-512/256,  offer  the  same  set  of  digest  lengths.  Thus,  the  SHA-3  hash
functions can be implemented as alternatives to the SHA-2 functions, or vice versa.

An extendable-output function (XOF) is a function on bit strings (also called messages) in which
the output can be extended to any desired length. The two SHA-3 XOFs are named SHAKE128
and  SHAKE256.3  The  suffixes  “128”  and  “256”  indicate  the  security  strengths  that  these  two
functions can generally4 support, in contrast to the suffixes for the hash functions, which indicate
the digest lengths. SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 are the first XOFs that NIST has standardized.

The  six  SHA-3  functions  are  designed  to  provide  special  properties,  such  as  resistance  to
collision, preimage, and second preimage attacks. The level of resistance to these three types of
attacks is summarized in Sec. A.1. Cryptographic hash functions are fundamental components in
a  variety  of  information  security  applications,  such  as  digital  signature  generation  and
verification, key derivation, and pseudorandom bit generation.

The digest lengths in FIPS-approved hash functions are 160, 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits. When
an application requires a cryptographic hash function with a non-standard digest length, an XOF
is  a  natural  alternative  to  constructions  that  involve  multiple  invocations  of  a  hash  function
and/or  truncation  of  the  output  bits.  However,  XOFs  are  subject  to  the  additional  security
consideration that is described in Sec. A.2.

Each  of  the  six  SHA-3  functions  employs  the  same  underlying  permutation  as  the  main
component  in  the  sponge  construction.  In  effect,  the  SHA-3  functions  are  modes  of  operation

1 More precisely, the competition called for four hash functions, and KECCAK is a larger family of functions.
2 For many hash functions, there is a (very large) bound on the length of the input data.
3 The name “SHAKE” was proposed in [5] to combine the term “Secure Hash Algorithm” with “KECCAK.”
4 An exception is when the output length is sufficiently small; see the discussion in Sec. A.1.

(modes)  of  the  permutation.  In  this  Standard,  the  permutation  is  specified  as  an  instance  of  a
family  of  permutations,  called  KECCAK-p,  in  order  to  provide  the  flexibility  to  modify  its  size
and security parameters in the development of any additional modes in future documents.

The four SHA-3 hash functions differ slightly from the instances of KECCAK that were proposed
for  the  SHA-3  competition  [3].  In  particular,  a  two-bit  suffix  is  appended  to  the  messages,  in
order  to  distinguish  the  SHA-3  hash  functions  from  the  SHA-3  XOFs,  and  to  facilitate  the
development  of  new  variants  of  the  SHA-3  functions  that  can  be  dedicated  to  individual
application domains.

The  two  SHA-3  XOFs  are  also  specified  in  a  manner  that  allows  for  the  development  of
dedicated variants. Moreover, the SHA-3 XOFs are compatible with the Sakura coding scheme
[6]  for  tree  hashing  [7],  in  order  to  support  the  development  of  parallelizable  variants  of  the
XOFs, to be specified in a separate document.

Most  of  the  notation  and  terminology  in  this  Standard  is  consistent  with  the  specification  of
KECCAK in [8].

0s

len(X)

X[i]

For a positive integer s, 0s is the string that consists of s consecutive 0s. If
s = 0, then 0s is the empty string.

For a bit string X, len(X) is the length of X in bits.

For a string X and an integer i such that 0 ≤ i < len(X), X[i] is the bit of X
with  index i. Bit strings are depicted with  indices  increasing from left  to
right, so that X[0] appears at the left, followed by X[1], etc. For example,
if X = 101000, then X[2] = 1.

Truncs (X)

For a positive integer s and a string X, Truncs (X) is the string comprised of
bits X[0] to X[s – 1].  For example, Trunc2(10100) = 10.

X  Y

X || Y

m/n

For strings X and Y of equal bit length, X  Y is the string that results from
applying  the  Boolean  exclusive-OR  operation  to  X  and  Y  at  each  bit
position.  For example, 1100 ⊕ 1010 = 0110.

For strings X and Y, X || Y is the concatenation of X and Y. For example,
11001 || 010 = 11001010.

For integers m and n, m/n is the quotient, i.e., m divided by n.

5

m mod n

x

log2(x)

min(x, y)

For integers m and n, m mod n is the integer r for which 0 ≤ r < n and mr
is a multiple of n.  For example, 11 mod 5 = 1, and 11 mod 5 = 4.

For a real number x, x is the least integer that is not strictly less than x.
For example, 3.2 = 4, 3.2 = 3, and 6 = 6.

For a positive real number x, log2(x) is the real number y such that 2y = x.

For  real  numbers  x  and  y,  min(x,  y)  is  the  minimum  of  x  and  y.  For
example, min(9, 33) = 9.

3  KECCAK-p PERMUTATIONS

In  this  section,  the  KECCAK-p  permutations  are  specified,  with  two  parameters:  1)  the  fixed
length of the strings that are permuted, called the width of the permutation, and 2) the number of
iterations  of  an  internal  transformation,  called  a  round.  The  width  is  denoted  by  b,  and  the
number  of  rounds  is  denoted  by  nr.  The  KECCAK-p  permutation  with  nr  rounds  and  width  b  is
denoted by KECCAK-p[b, nr]; the permutation is defined for any b in {25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800,
1600} and any positive integer nr.

A  round  of  a  KECCAK-p  permutation,  denoted  by  Rnd,  consists  of  a  sequence  of  five
transformations, which are called the step mappings. The permutation is specified in terms of an
array of values for b bits that is repeatedly updated, called the state; the state is initially set to the
input values of the permutation.

The  notation  and  terminology  for  the  state  are  described  in  Sec.  3.1.  The  step  mappings  are
specified  in  Sec.  3.2.  The  KECCAK-p  permutations,  including  the  round  function  Rnd,  are
specified  in  Sec.  3.3.  The  relationship  of  the  KECCAK-p  permutations  to  the  KECCAK-f
permutations that were defined for KECCAK in [8] is described in Sec. 3.4.

3.1  State

The state for the KECCAK-p[b, nr] permutation is comprised of b bits. The specifications in this
Standard  contain  two  other  quantities  related  to  b:  b/25  and  log2(b/25),  denoted  by  w  and  l,
respectively.  The  seven  possible  values  for  these  variables  that  are  defined  for  the  KECCAK-p
permutations are given in the columns of Table 1 below.

Table 1:  KECCAK-p permutation widths and related quantities

It is convenient to represent the input and output states of the permutation as b-bit strings, and to
represent  the  input  and  output  states  of  the  step  mappings  as  5-by-5-by-w  arrays  of  bits.  If  S
denotes a string that represents the state, then its bits are indexed from 0 to b–1, so that

S = S[0] || S[1] ||  … || S[b-2] || S[b-1].

7

If A denotes a 5-by-5-by-w array of bits that represents the state, then its indices are the integer
triples (x, y, z) for which 0 ≤ x < 5, 0 ≤ y < 5, and 0 ≤ z < w. The bit that corresponds to (x, y, z) is
denoted by A[x, y, z]. A state array is a representation of the state by a three-dimensional array
that is indexed in this manner.

3.1.1  Parts of the State Array

Figure 1:  Parts of the state array, organized by dimension [8]

8

The state array for a KECCAK-p permutation, and its lower-dimensional sub-arrays, are illustrated
in Figure 1 above for the case b = 200, so that w = 8. The two-dimensional sub-arrays are called
sheets, planes, and  slices, and the single-dimensional sub-arrays  are called  rows, columns, and
lanes. The algebraic definitions of these sub-arrays are given in the Glossary, in Sec. 2.1.

3.1.2  Converting Strings to State Arrays

Let S denote a string of b bits that represents the state for the KECCAK-p[b, nr] permutation. The
corresponding state array, denoted by A, is defined as follows:

For all triples (x, y, z) such that 0 ≤ x < 5, 0 ≤ y < 5, and 0 ≤ z < w,

A[x, y, z] = S [w(5y + x) + z].

For example, if b= 1600, so that w= 64, then

A[0, 0, 0] = S [0]
A[0, 0, 1] = S [1]
A[0, 0, 2] = S [2]

3.1.3  Converting State Arrays to Strings

Let  A  denote  a  state  array.  The  corresponding  string  representation,  denoted  by  S,  can  be
constructed from the lanes and planes of A, as follows:

For each pair of integers (i, j) such that 0 ≤ i < 5 and 0 ≤ j < 5, define the string Lane (i, j) by

Lane (i, j) = A[i, j, 0] || A[i, j, 1] || A[i, j, 2] || … || A[i, j, w-2] || A[i, j, w-1].

For example, if b = 1600, so that w = 64, then

Lane (0, 0) = A[0, 0, 0] || A[0, 0, 1] || A[0, 0, 2] || … || A[0, 0, 62] || A[0, 0, 63]
Lane (1, 0) = A[1, 0, 0] || A[1, 0, 1] || A[1, 0, 2] || … || A[1, 0, 62] || A[1, 0, 63]
Lane (2, 0) = A[2, 0, 0] || A[2, 0, 1] || A[2, 0, 2] || … || A[2, 0, 62] || A[2, 0, 63]

etc.

For each integer j such that 0 ≤ j < 5, define the string Plane (j) by

Plane (j) = Lane (0, j) || Lane (1, j) || Lane (2, j) || Lane (3, j) || Lane (4, j).

Then

S = Plane (0) || Plane (1) || Plane (2) || Plane (3) || Plane (4).

For example, if b = 1600, so that w = 64, then

       S =  A[0, 0, 0] || A[0, 0, 1] || A[0, 0, 2] || … || A[0, 0, 62] || A[0, 0, 63]
|| A[1, 0, 0] || A[1, 0, 1] || A[1, 0, 2] || … || A[1, 0, 62] || A[1, 0, 63]
|| A[2, 0, 0] || A[2, 0, 1] || A[2, 0, 2] || … || A[2, 0, 62] || A[2, 0, 63]
|| A[3, 0, 0] || A[3, 0, 1] || A[3, 0, 2] || … || A[3, 0, 62] || A[3, 0, 63]
|| A[4, 0, 0] || A[4, 0, 1] || A[4, 0, 2] || … || A[4, 0, 62] || A[4, 0, 63]

|| A[0, 1, 0] || A[0, 1, 1] || A[0, 1, 2] || … || A[0, 1, 62] || A[0, 1, 63]
|| A[1, 1, 0] || A[1, 1, 1] || A[1, 1, 2] || … || A[1, 1, 62] || A[1, 1, 63]
|| A[2, 1, 0] || A[2, 1, 1] || A[2, 1, 2] || … || A[2, 1, 62] || A[2, 1, 63]
|| A[3, 1, 0] || A[3, 1, 1] || A[3, 1, 2] || … || A[3, 1, 62] || A[3, 1, 63]
|| A[4, 1, 0] || A[4, 1, 1] || A[4, 1, 2] || … || A[4, 1, 62] || A[4, 1, 63]

3.1.4  Labeling Convention for the State Array

Figure 2:  The x, y, and z coordinates for the diagrams of the step mappings

In the diagrams of the state that accompany the specifications of the step mappings, the lane that
corresponds to the coordinates (x, y) = (0, 0) is depicted at the center of the slices. The complete
labeling of the x, y, and z coordinates for those diagrams is shown in Figure 2 above.

3.2  Step Mappings

The five step mappings that comprise a round of KECCAK-p[b, nr] are denoted by θ, ρ, π, χ, and ι.
Specifications for these functions are given in Secs. 3.2.1-3.2.5.

The algorithm for each step mapping takes a state array, denoted by A, as an input and returns an
updated  state  array,  denoted  by  A′,  as  the  output.  The  size  of  the  state  is  a  parameter  that  is
omitted from the notation, because b is always specified when the step mappings are invoked.

The ι mapping ir has a second input: an integer called the round index, denoted by ir, which is
defined  within  Algorithm  7  for  KECCAK-p[b,  nr],  in  Sec.  3.3.  The  other  step  mappings  do  not
depend on the round index.

3.2.1  Specification of θ

Algorithm 1: θ(A)

Input:
state array A.

Output:
state array A′.

y 3   4   0   1   2        2 104 3        x z 0 1 2 3 … w−1

Steps:

1.  For all pairs (x, z) such that 0 ≤ x < 5 and 0 ≤ z < w, let

C[x, z] = A[x, 0, z] ⊕ A[x, 1, z] ⊕ A[x, 2, z] ⊕ A[x, 3, z] ⊕ A[x, 4, z].

2.  For all pairs (x, z) such that 0 ≤ x < 5 and 0 ≤ z < w let

D[x, z] = C[(x1) mod 5, z] ⊕ C[(x+1) mod 5, (z – 1) mod w].

3.  For all triples (x, y, z) such that 0 ≤ x < 5, 0 ≤ y < 5, and 0 ≤ z < w, let

A′[x, y, z] = A[x, y, z] ⊕ D[x, z].

The effect of θ is to XOR each bit in the state with the parities of two columns in the array. In
particular, for the bit A[x0, y0, z0], the x-coordinate of one of the columns is (x0  1) mod 5, with
the same z-coordinate, z0, while the x-coordinate of the other column is  (x0 + 1) mod 5, with z-
coordinate (z0  1) mod w.

In the illustration of the θ step mapping in Figure 3 below, the summation symbol, ∑, indicates
the parity, i.e., the XOR sum of all the bits in the column.

Figure 3:  Illustration of θ applied to a single bit [8]

3.2.2  Specification of ρ

Algorithm 2: ρ(A)

Input:
state array A.

Output:
state array A′.

Steps:

1.  For all z such that 0 ≤ z < w, let A′ [0, 0, z]  = A[0, 0, z].
2.  Let (x, y) = (1, 0).

12

3.   For t from 0 to 23:

a.  for all z such that 0 ≤ z < w, let A′[x, y, z]  =  A[x, y, (z – (t + 1)(t + 2)/2) mod w];
b.  let (x, y) = (y, (2x + 3y) mod 5).

4.  Return A′.

The effect of ρ is to rotate the bits of each lane by a length, called the offset, which depends on
the fixed x and y coordinates of the lane. Equivalently, for each bit in the lane, the z coordinate is
modified by adding the offset, modulo the lane size.

Table 2:  Offsets of ρ [8]

The offsets for each lane that result from the computation in Step 3a in Algorithm 2 are listed in
Table 2 above.

An illustration of ρ for the case w = 8 is given in Figure 4 below. The labeling convention for the
x  and  y  coordinates  in  Figure  4  is  given  explicitly  in  Figure  2,  corresponding  to  the  rows  and
columns in Table 2. For example, the lane A[0, 0] is depicted in the middle of the middle sheet,
and the lane A[2, 3] is depicted at the bottom of the right-most sheet.

Figure 4:  Illustration of ρ for b = 200 [8]

For each lane in Figure 4, the black dot indicates the bit whose z coordinate is 0, and the shaded
cube indicates the position of that bit after the execution of ρ. The other bits of the lane shift by
the same offset, and the shift is circular. For example, the offset for the lane A[1, 0] is 1, so the
last bit, whose z coordinate is 7 for this example, shifts to the front position, whose z coordinate

13

is 0. Consequently, the offsets may be reduced modulo the lane size; e.g., the lane for A[3, 2], at
the top of the left-most sheet, has an offset of 153 mod 8 for this example, i.e., the offset is 1 bit.

3.2.3  Specification of π

Algorithm 3: π(A)

Input:
state array A.

Output:
state array A′.

Steps:

1.  For all triples (x, y, z) such that 0 ≤ x < 5, 0 ≤ y < 5, and 0 ≤ z < w, let

 A′[x, y, z]= A[(x + 3y) mod 5, x, z].

2.  Return A′.

The effect of π is to rearrange the positions of the lanes, as illustrated for any slice in Figure 5
below.  The  convention  for  the  labeling  of  the  coordinates  is  depicted  in  Figure  2  above;  for
example, the bit with coordinates x = y = 0 is depicted at the center of the slice.

Figure 5:  Illustration of π applied to a single slice [8]

3.2.4  Specification of χ

Algorithm 4: χ(A)

Input:
state array A.

Output:
state array A′.

Steps:

1.  For all triples (x, y, z) such that 0 ≤ x < 5, 0 ≤ y < 5, and 0 ≤ z < w, let

A′ [x, y, z] = A[x, y, z] ⊕ ((A[(x+1) mod 5, y, z] ⊕ 1) ⋅  A[(x+2) mod 5, y, z]).

2.  Return A′.

The dot in the right side of the assignment for Step 1 indicates integer multiplication, which in
this case is equivalent to the intended Boolean “AND” operation.

The  effect  of  χ  is  to  XOR  each  bit  with  a  non-linear  function  of  two  other  bits  in  its  row,  as
illustrated in Figure 6 below.

Figure 6:  Illustration of χ applied to a single row [8]

3.2.5  Specification of ι

The ι mapping is parameterized by the round index,  ir, whose values are specified in Step 2 of
Algorithm  7  for  computing  KECCAK-p[b,  nr],  in  Sec.  3.3.  Within  the  specification  of  ι  in
Algorithm 6 below, this parameter determines l + 1 bits of a lane value called the round constant,
denoted  by  RC.  Each  of  these  l  +  1  bits  is  generated  by  a  function  that  is  based  on  a  linear
feedback shift register. This function, denoted by rc, is specified in Algorithm 5.

15

Algorithm 5: rc(t)

Input:
integer t.

Output:
bit rc(t).

Steps:

1.  If t mod 255 = 0, return 1.
2.  Let R = 10000000.
3.  For i from 1 to t mod 255, let:

a.  R = 0 || R;
b.  R[0] = R[0] ⊕ R[8];
c.  R[4] = R[4] ⊕ R[8];
d.  R[5] = R[5] ⊕ R[8];
e.  R[6] = R[6] ⊕ R[8];
f.  R =Trunc8[R].

4.  Return R[0].

Algorithm 6: ι(A, ir)

Input:
state array A;
round index ir.

Output:
state array A′.

Steps:

1.  For all triples (x, y, z) such that 0 ≤ x < 5, 0 ≤ y < 5, and 0 ≤ z < w, let A′[x, y, z] = A[x, y, z].
2.  Let RC = 0w.
3.  For j from 0 to l, let RC[2j
4.  For all z such that 0 ≤ z < w, let A′ [0, 0, z] = A′ [0, 0, z] ⊕ RC[z].
5.  Return A′.

 – 1] = rc(j + 7ir).

The effect of ι is to modify some of the bits of Lane (0, 0) in a manner that depends on the round
index ir. The other 24 lanes are not affected by ι.

3.3  KECCAK-p[b, nr]

Given  a  state  array  A  and  a  round  index  ir,  the  round  function  Rnd  is  the  transformation  that
results from applying the step mappings θ, ρ, π, χ, and ι, in that order, i.e.,:

Rnd(A, ir) = ι(χ(π(ρ(θ(A)))), ir).

16

The KECCAK-p[b, nr] permutation consists of nr iterations of Rnd, as specified in Algorithm 7.

Algorithm 7: KECCAK-p[b, nr](S)

Input:
string S of length b;
number of rounds nr.

Output:
string S′ of length b.

Steps:

1.  Convert S into a state array, A, as described in Sec. 3.1.2.
2.  For ir from 12 + 2l – nr to 12 + 2l  – 1, let A = Rnd(A, ir).
3.  Convert A into a string S′ of length b, as described in Sec. 3.1.3.
4.  Return  S′.

3.4  Comparison with KECCAK-f

The  KECCAK-f  family  of  permutations,  originally  defined  in  [8],  is  the  specialization  of  the
KECCAK-p family to the case that nr = 12 + 2l :

KECCAK-f [b] = KECCAK-p[b, 12 + 2l].

Consequently, the KECCAK-p[1600, 24] permutation, which underlies the six SHA-3 functions, is
equivalent to KECCAK-f [1600].

The rounds of KECCAK-f [b] are indexed from 0 to 11 + 2l . A result of the indexing within Step 2
of Algorithm 7 is that the rounds of KECCAK-p[b, nr] match the last rounds of KECCAK-f [b], or
vice  versa.  For  example,  KECCAK-p[1600,  19]  is  equivalent  to  the  last  nineteen  rounds  of
KECCAK-f  [1600].  Similarly,  KECCAK-f  [1600]  is  equivalent  to  the  last  twenty-four  rounds  of
KECCAK-p[1600, 30]; in this case, the preceding rounds for KECCAK-p[1600, 30] are indexed by
the integers from −6 to −1.

4  SPONGE CONSTRUCTION

The sponge construction [4] is a framework for specifying functions on binary data with arbitrary
output length. The construction employs the following three components:

  An underlying function on fixed-length strings, denoted by f,
  A parameter called the rate, denoted by r, and
  A padding rule, denoted by pad.

The function that the construction produces from these components is called a sponge function,
denoted by SPONGE[f, pad, r]. A sponge function takes two inputs: a bit string, denoted by N, and

17

the bit length, denoted by d, of the output string, SPONGE[f, pad, r](N, d). The analogy to a sponge
is that an arbitrary number of input bits are “absorbed” into the state of the function, after which
an arbitrary number of output bits are “squeezed” out of its state.

The sponge construction is illustrated in Figure 7 below, adapted from [4].

Figure 7:  The sponge construction: Z = SPONGE[f, pad, r](N, d) [4]

The function f maps strings of a single, fixed length, denoted by b, to strings of the same length.
As in Sec. 3, b is called the width of f. The SHA-3 functions, specified in Sec. 6 are instances of
the  sponge  construction  in  which  the  underlying  function  f  is  invertible,  i.e.,  a  permutation,
although the sponge construction does not require f to be invertible.

The rate r is a positive integer that is strictly less than the width b. The capacity, denoted by c, is
the positive integer br. Thus, r + c = b.

The  padding  rule,  pad,  is  a  function  that  produces  padding,  i.e.,  a  string  with  an  appropriate
length  to  append  to  another  string.  In  general,  given  a  positive  integer  x  and  a  non-negative
integer m, the output pad(x, m) is a string with the property that m + len(pad(x, m)) is a positive
multiple  of  x.  Within  the  sponge  construction,  x  =  r  and  m  =  len(N),  so  that  the  padded  input
string  can  be  partitioned  into  a  sequence  of  r-bit  strings.  Algorithm  9  in  Sec.  5.1  specifies  the
padding rule for the KECCAK functions and, hence, the SHA-3 functions.

Given these three components, f, pad, and r, as described above, the  SPONGE[f, pad, r] function
on (N, d) is specified by Algorithm 8. The width b is determined by the choice of f.

Algorithm 8: SPONGE[f, pad, r](N, d)

Input:
string N,
nonnegative integer d.

18

Output:
string Z such that len(Z) = d.

Steps:

1.  Let P = N || pad(r, len(N)).
2.  Let n = len(P)/r.
3.  Let c = b  r.
4.  Let P0, … , Pn-1 be the unique sequence of strings of length r such that P = P0 || … || Pn1.
5.  Let S = 0b.
6.  For i from 0 to n1, let S = f (S ⊕ (Pi || 0c)).
7.  Let Z be the empty string.
8.  Let Z = Z || Trunc r (S).
9.  If d ≤ |Z|, then return Trunc d (Z); else continue.
10. Let S = f(S), and continue with Step 8.

Note  that  the  input  d  determines  the  number  of  bits  that  Algorithm  8  returns,  but  it  does  not
affect  their  values.  In  principle,  the  output  can  be  regarded  as  an  infinite  string,  whose
computation, in practice, is halted after the desired number of output bits is produced.

5  KECCAK

KECCAK is a family of sponge functions, originally defined in [8]. The padding rule for KECCAK,
called  multi-rate  padding,  is  specified  in  Sec.  5.1.  The  parameters  and  the  underlying
permutations for KECCAK are described in Sec. 5.2, and a smaller family of KECCAK functions,
KECCAK[c], is specified explicitly, which will suffice to define the SHA-3 functions in Sec. 6.

5.1  Specification of pad10*1

Algorithm 9: pad10*1(x, m)

Input:
positive integer x;
non-negative integer m.

Output:
string P such that m + len(P) is a positive multiple of x.

Steps:

1.  Let j = (– m – 2) mod x.
2.  Return P = 1 || 0j || 1.

Thus,  the  asterisk  in  “pad10*1”  indicates  that  the  “0”  bit  is  either  omitted  or  repeated  as
necessary in order to produce an output string of the desired length.

19

5.2  Specification of KECCAK[c]

KECCAK is the family of sponge functions with the KECCAK-p[b, 12 + 2l] permutation (defined in
Sec 3.3) as the underlying function and with pad10*1 (defined in Sec. 5.1) as the padding rule.
The family is parameterized by any choices of the rate r and the capacity c such that r + c is in
{25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600}, i.e., one of the seven values for b in Table 1.

When restricted to the case b = 1600, the KECCAK family is denoted by KECCAK[c]; in this case r
is determined by the choice of c. In particular,

KECCAK[c] = SPONGE[KECCAK-p[1600, 24], pad10*1, 1600 – c].

Thus, given an input bit string N and an output length d,

KECCAK[c] (N, d) = SPONGE[KECCAK-p[1600, 24], pad10*1, 1600 – c] (N, d).

6  SHA-3 FUNCTION SPECIFICATIONS

In Sec. 6.1, the four SHA-3 hash functions are defined, and in Sec. 6.2, the two SHA-3 XOFs are
defined.  In  Sec.  6.3,  an  alternate  definition  of  each  SHA-3  XOF  is  given  in  terms  of  an
intermediate function.

6.1  SHA-3 Hash Functions

Given  a  message  M,  the  four  SHA-3  hash  functions  are  defined  from  the  KECCAK[c]  function
specified  in  Sec.  5.2  by  appending  a  two-bit  suffix  to  M  and  by  specifying  the  length  of  the
output, as follows:

SHA3-224(M) = KECCAK[448] (M || 01, 224);
SHA3-256(M) = KECCAK[512] (M || 01, 256);
SHA3-384(M) = KECCAK[768] (M || 01, 384);
SHA3-512(M) = KECCAK[1024] (M || 01, 512).

In  each case, the  capacity  is  double the digest  length,  i.e.,  c  = 2d,  and the  resulting  input N to
KECCAK[c] is the message with the suffix appended, i.e, N = M || 01. The suffix supports domain
separation; i.e., it distinguishes the inputs to KECCAK[c] arising from the SHA-3 hash functions
from the inputs arising from the SHA-3 XOFs defined in Sec. 6.2, as well as other domains that
may be defined in the future.

6.2  SHA-3 Extendable-Output Functions

Given a message M, the two SHA-3 XOFs, SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, are defined from the
KECCAK[c]  function  specified  in  Sec.  5.2  by  appending  a  four-bit  suffix  to  M,  for  any  output
length d:

20

SHAKE128(M, d) = KECCAK[256] (M || 1111, d),
SHAKE256(M, d) = KECCAK[512] (M || 1111, d).

The purposes of the additional bits, 1111, are discussed in Sec. 6.3.

6.3  Alternate Definitions of SHA-3 Extendable-Output Functions

Two  additional  sponge  functions,  called  RawSHAKE128  and  RawSHAKE256,  are  defined  as
the  following  instances  of  KECCAK[c],  where  the  input  string  is  denoted  by  J,  and  the  output
length denoted by d:

RawSHAKE128(J, d) = KECCAK[256] (J || 11, d),
RawSHAKE256(J, d) = KECCAK[512] (J || 11, d).

These functions enable alternate definitions of SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 that are equivalent
to the definitions in Sec. 6.2. In particular,

SHAKE128(M, d) = RawSHAKE128 (M || 11, d),
SHAKE256(M, d) = RawSHAKE256 (M || 11, d).

The following input N to KECCAK[c] results from the padding of these inputs M and J:

N = J || 11 = M || 11 || 11.

The bolded suffix (i.e., 11) supports domain separation: it distinguishes the inputs to KECCAK[c]
that  arise  from  RawSHAKE128  and  RawSHAKE256  from  the  inputs  arising  from  the  SHA-3
hash functions defined in Sec. 6.1, as well as other domains that may be defined in the future.

The italicized suffix (i.e., 11) provides compatibility for RawSHAKE128 and RawSHAKE256
with  the  Sakura  coding  scheme  [6].  This  scheme  will  facilitate  the  future  development  of  tree
hashing [7] variants, in which parallel processing can be applied to compute and update digests
of long messages more efficiently.

Note that, within the execution of KECCAK[c], additional bits are appended to N as specified by
the multi-rate padding rule.

7  Conformance

Implementations  of  the  KECCAK-p[1600,  24]  permutation  and  the  six  SHA-3  modes  of  this
permutation—SHA3-224,  SHA3-256,  SHA3-384,  SHA3-512,  SHAKE128,  and  SHAKE256—
may  be  tested  for  conformance  to  this  Standard  under  the  auspices  of  the  Cryptographic
Algorithm Validation Program [9].

21

SHA3-224, SHA3-256,  SHA3-384,  and SHA3-512 are approved  cryptographic hash functions.
One  of  the  approved  uses  of  cryptographic  hash  functions  occurs  within  the  Keyed-Hash
Message  Authentication  Code  (HMAC).  The  input  block  size  in  bytes,  denoted  by  B  in  the
HMAC specification [10], is given in Table 3 below for the SHA-3 hash functions5:

Table 3:  Input block sizes for HMAC

SHAKE128  and  SHAKE256  are  approved  XOFs,  whose  approved  uses  will  be  specified  in
NIST Special Publications. Although some of those uses may overlap with the uses of approved
hash  functions,  the  XOFs  are  not  approved  as  hash  functions,  due  to  the  property  that  is
discussed in Sec. A.2.

The KECCAK-p[1600, 24] permutation is approved for use in the context of its approved modes of
operation,  such  as  the  SHA-3  functions.  Similarly,  the  other  intermediate  functions  that  are
defined  in  this  Standard—e.g.,  KECCAK[c],  RawSHAKE128,  and  RawSHAKE256—are
approved  in  the  context  of  an  approved  mode  of  operation  of  the  underlying  KECCAK-p
permutation.

The KECCAK-p[1600, 24] permutation may become approved for other uses, and other KECCAK-p
permutations may also become approved if any modes of operation for them are developed and
approved within a FIPS Publication or a NIST Special Publication.

The SHA-3 functions are defined on messages of any bit length, including the empty string.  A
conforming implementation of a SHA-3 function may restrict the set of supported bit lengths for
messages.  Similarly,  a  conforming  implementation  of  a  SHA-3  XOF  may  restrict  the  set  of
supported  values  for  the  output  length.  In  both  cases,  any  such  restrictions  may  affect
interoperability with other implementations.

For  every  computational  procedure  that  is  specified  in  this  Standard,  a  conforming
implementation  may  replace  the  given  set  of  steps  with  any  mathematically  equivalent  set  of
steps.  In  other  words,  different  procedures  that  produce  the  correct  output  for  every  input  are
permitted.

5 In general, the input block size (in bits) of a sponge function is its rate.

A  Security

The detailed analysis of the security properties of KECCAK in [8] applies to the SHA-3 family of
hash and extendable output  functions. The SHA-3 family  also  inherits  security properties from
the sponge construction; these properties are analyzed in detail in [4].

Applications  of  hash  functions  often  require  collision  resistance,  preimage  resistance,  and/or
second  preimage  resistance;  these  properties  are  summarized  for  the  SHA-3  family  of  hash
functions and  XOFs in  Sec. A.1. XOFs differ from  hash functions in  the generation of  closely
related outputs; this important security consideration is discussed in Sec. A.2.

A.1  Summary

As  of  the  publication  of  this  Standard,  the  security  strengths  of  the  SHA-3  functions  are
summarized  in  Table  4.  The  SHA-1  and  SHA-2  functions  are  included  for  comparison,
duplicating  some  of  the  discussion  in  [11],  which  will  be  updated  as  necessary  with  the  latest
security information.

Table 4:  Security strengths of the SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3 functions

23

For the security strength against second preimage attacks on a message M, the function L(M) is
defined as log2(len(M)/B), where B is the block length of the function in bits, i.e., B = 512 for
SHA-1, SHA-224, and SHA-256, and B = 1024 for SHA-512.

The four SHA-3 hash functions are alternatives to the SHA-2 functions, and they are designed to
provide  resistance  against  collision,  preimage,  and  second  preimage  attacks  that  equals  or
exceeds the resistance that the corresponding SHA-2 functions provide. The SHA-3 functions are
also designed to resist other attacks, such as length-extension attacks, that would be resisted by a
random function of the same output length, in general providing the same security strength as a
random function, up to the output length.

The two SHA-3 XOFs are designed to  resist collision, preimage, and second-preimage attacks,
and other attacks that would be resisted by a random function of the requested output length, up
to  the  security  strength  of  128  bits  for  SHAKE128,  and  256  bits  for  SHAKE256.  A  random
function  whose  output  length  is  d  bits  cannot  provide  more  than  d/2  bits  of  security  against
collision  attacks  and  d  bits  of  security  against  preimage  and  second  preimage  attacks,  so
SHAKE128  and  SHAKE256  will  provide  less  than  128  and  256  bits  of  security,  respectively,
when d is sufficiently small, as described in Table 4. For example, if d = 224, then SHAKE128
and SHAKE256 provide 112 bits of collision resistance; however, they provide different levels
of preimage resistance: 128 bits for SHAKE128 and 224 bits for SHAKE256.

If d > r + c/2, then SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 provide more than 128 and 256 bits of preimage
resistance, respectively; moreover, if d > 1600, a preimage probably does not exist.

A.2  Additional Consideration for Extendable-Output Functions

An XOF is a powerful new kind of cryptographic primitive that offers the flexibility to produce
outputs with any desired length. Technically, it is possible to use an XOF as a hash function by
selecting  a  fixed  output  length.  However,  XOFs  have  the  potential  for  generating  related
outputs—a property that designers of security applications/protocols/systems may not expect of
hash  functions.  This  property  is  important  to  consider  in  the  development  of  applications  of
XOFs.

By design, the output length for an XOF does not affect the bits that it produces, which means
that the output length is not a necessary input to the function. Conceptually, the output can be an
infinite string, and the application/protocol/system that invokes the function simply computes the
desired number of initial bits of that string. Consequently, when two different output lengths are
chosen  for  a  common  message,  the  two  outputs  are  closely  related:  the  longer  output  is  an
extension  of  the  shorter  output.  For  example,  given  any  positive  integers  d  and  e,  and  any
message  M,  Truncd(SHAKE128(M,  d+e))  is  identical  to  SHAKE128(M,  d).  The  same  property
holds for SHAKE256.

No two distinct SHA-3 functions would be expected to ever exhibit this property in practice. For
example,  for  a  randomly  chosen  message  M,  SHA3-256(M)  will  almost  certainly  not  be  an
extension  of  SHA3-224(M),  or  of  SHAKE128(M,  224),  even  though  the  three  functions  have

24

almost  identical  structure.  The  same  statement  applies  to  previously  approved  hash  functions,
including the truncated versions of SHA-512 in FIPS 180-4 (e.g., SHA-512/256).

However,  existing  mechanisms  for  constructing  functions  with  arbitrary  output  length—by
concatenating and/or truncating digests from hash functions—generally do exhibit this property.

The

application/protocol/system that invokes an XOF. For example, a naïve (and non-approved) way
for  two  parties  to  agree  to  derive  a  112-bit  Triple  DES  key  from  a  message  designated  as
keymaterial would be to compute SHAKE128(keymaterial, keylength), where keylength is 112.
However, if an attacker is able to induce one of the parties to use a different value for keylength,
say  168  bits,  but  the  same  value  for  keymaterial,  then  the  two  parties  will  end  up  with  the
following keys:

SHAKE128(keymaterial, 168) = fgh,

where the bolded letters of the digest represent 56-bit strings, e.g., the parts of a Triple DES key.
Because of the structure of Triple DES, these keys are vulnerable to attack.

In practice, the use of an XOF as a key derivation function (KDF) could preclude the possibility
of related outputs, by incorporating the  length  and/or type  of the derived  key  into the message
input  to  the  KDF.  In  that  case,  a  disagreement  or  misunderstanding  between  two  users  of  the
KDF  about  the  type  or  length  of  the  key  they  are  deriving  would  almost  certainly  not  lead  to
related outputs.

Where extended digests are problematic, a more general solution is domain separation, by which
different instances of the XOFs could be created and tailored to different purposes, independent
of the number of output bits. All of the SHA-3 functions are designed to allow variants for new,
separate domains that NIST may develop in the future.

B  Examples

Examples of the five step mappings and of the six SHA-3 functions are available at the examples
page  at  NIST’s  Computer  Security  Resource  Center  web  site:  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST
/toolkit/examples.html.

The bit strings for these examples are represented as hexadecimal strings, i.e., sequences of the
sixteen hexadecimal digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F, where A is the digit
for ten, B is the digit for eleven, etc.

The convention for interpreting hexadecimal  strings as bit strings for the inputs and outputs of
the SHA-3 examples is different from the convention for other functions on the examples page.
The  conversion  functions  between  hexadecimal  strings  and  SHA-3  bit  strings  are  specified  in
Sec.  B.1.  For  byte-aligned  messages,  the  hexadecimal  forms  of  the  padding  for  the  SHA-3
functions are described in Sec. B.2.

25

Specific hexadecimal strings in these sections are written in the Courier New font, preceded
by the marker 0x.

B.1  Conversion Functions

The  conversion  function  from  hexadecimal  strings  to  the  SHA-3  strings  that  they  represent,
denoted h2b, is specified in Algorithm 10. The function is defined on hexadecimal strings with
an even number of digits.

Algorithm 10: h2b(H, n).

Input:
hexadecimal string H consisting of 2m digits for some positive integer m;
positive integer n such that n ≤ 8m.

Output:
bit string S, such that len(S) = n.

Steps:

1.

For each integer i such that 0 ≤ i < 2m-1, let Hi be the ith hexadecimal digit in H:
H = H0 H1 H2 H3 … H2m-2 H2m-1.
For each integer i such that 0 ≤ i < m:
a.  Let hi = 16 ⋅  H2i +H2i+1.
b.  Let bi0 bi1 bi2 bi3 bi4 bi5 bi6 bi7 be the unique sequence of bits such that
 + bi4⋅ 24

.
For each pair of integers (i, j) such that 0 ≤ i < m and 0 ≤ j < 8, let T [8i + j] = bij.
Return S = Truncn(T).

hi = bi7⋅ 27

 + bi6⋅ 26

 + bi0⋅ 20

 + bi3⋅ 23

 + bi2⋅ 22

 + bi5⋅ 25

 + bi1⋅ 21

In Step 1, the indices are defined for the hexadecimal digits. In Step 2a, each pair of hexadecimal
digits is converted to the (base 10) integer between 0 and 255 that the pair represents in base 16.
In Step 2b, each integer from Step 2a is converted to its binary representation as a byte. In Step
3, the bytes are combined into a single string, and the result is truncated to the desired number of
bits in Step 4.

For example, if H = 0x A3 2E and n = 14, then the intermediate values that are defined in Steps 1
and 2 of Algorithm 10 are indicated in Table 5 below:

H0 = A

H1 = 3

H2 = 2

H3 = E

Thus, T = b00 b01 b02 b03 b04 b05 b06 b07 b10 b11 b12 b13 b14 b15 b16 b17 = 1100 0101 0111 0100, and
S = Trunc14(T ) = 1100 0101 0111 01, as described in Steps 3 and 4.

If the length n of the output string S is not specified explicitly as an input, then h2b(H) is defined
to be h2b(H, 8m), i.e., n is given the maximum possible value.

The conversion function from SHA-3 bit strings to the hexadecimal strings that represent them,
denoted b2h, is specified in Algorithm 11.

Algorithm 11: b2h(S).

Input:
bit string S consisting of n bits for a positive integer n.

The formal bit-reordering function that was specified in [12]—for the KECCAK submission to the
SHA-3 competition—gives equivalent conversions when the message is byte-aligned, i.e., when
n is a multiple of 8.

B.2  Hexadecimal Form of Padding Bits

For  the  SHA-3  functions,  either  a  two-  or  four-bit  suffix  is  appended  to  the  message  M  to
produce the input string N to KECCAK[c], and additional bits are appended as part of the multi-
rate padding rule.

For most applications, the message is byte-aligned, i.e., len(M) = 8m for a nonnegative integer m.
In  this  case,  the  total  number  of  bytes,  denoted  by  q,  that  are  appended  to  the  message  is
determined as follows by m and the rate r:

q = (r/8) – (m mod (r/8)).

27

The  value  of  q  determines  the  hexadecimal  form  of  these  bytes  in  this  case  according  to  the
conversion functions specified in Sec. B.1. The padded messages that result are summarized in
Table 6:
