Timing diagrams

The figure named Key to timing diagram conventions explains the components used in timing
diagrams. Variations, when they occur, have clear labels. You must not assume any timing
information that is not explicit in the diagrams.

Shaded bus and signal areas are undefined, so the bus or signal can assume any value within the
shaded area at that time. The actual level is unimportant and does not affect normal operation.

Clock

HIGH to LOW

Transient

HIGH/LOW to HIGH

Bus stable

Bus to high impedance

Bus change

High impedance to stable bus

Key to timing diagram conventions

Timing diagrams sometimes show single-bit signals as HIGH and LOW at the same time and
they look similar to the bus change shown in Key to timing diagram conventions. If a timing
diagram shows a single-bit signal in this way then its value does not affect the accompanying
description.

Signals

The signal conventions are:

Signal level

The level of an asserted signal depends on whether the signal is
active-HIGH or active-LOW. Asserted means:
•
•

HIGH for active-HIGH signals
LOW for active-LOW signals.

Lower-case n

At the start or end of a signal name denotes an active-LOW signal.

About the APB protocol

Introduction

The Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) is part of the Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture
(AMBA) protocol family. It defines a low-cost interface that is optimized for minimal power
consumption and reduced interface complexity.

The APB protocol is not pipelined, use it to connect to low-bandwidth peripherals that do not
require the high performance of the AXI protocol.

The APB protocol relates a signal transition to the rising edge of the clock, to simplify the
integration of APB peripherals into any design flow. Every transfer takes at least two cycles.

The APB can interface with:
•
•
•
•

AMBA Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)
AMBA Advanced High-performance Bus Lite (AHB-Lite)
AMBA Advanced Extensible Interface (AXI)
AMBA Advanced Extensible Interface Lite (AXI4-Lite)

You can use it to access the programmable control registers of peripheral devices.

Introduction

1.2

APB revisions

The APB Specification Rev E, released in 1998, is now obsolete and is superseded by the
following three revisions:
•
•
•

AMBA 2 APB Specification
AMBA 3 APB Protocol Specification v1.0
AMBA APB Protocol Specification v2.0.

1.2.1

AMBA 2 APB Specification

The AMBA 2 APB Specification is detailed in AMBA Specification Rev 2 (ARM IHI 0011A).

This specification defines the interface signals, the basic read and write transfers, and the two
APB components the APB bridge and the APB slave.

This version of the specification is referred to as APB2.

1.2.2

AMBA 3 APB Protocol Specification v1.0

The AMBA 3 APB Protocol Specification v1.0 defines the following additional functionality:
•
•

Wait states. See Chapter 3 Transfers.
Error reporting. See Error response on page 3-6.

The following interface signals support this functionality:

PREADY  A ready signal to indicate completion of an APB transfer.

PSLVERR  An error signal to indicate the failure of a transfer.

This version of the specification is referred to as APB3.

1.2.3

AMBA APB Protocol Specification v2.0

The AMBA APB Protocol Specification v2.0 defines the following additional functionality:
•
•

Transaction protection. See Protection unit support on page 3-8.
Sparse data transfer. See Write strobes on page 3-4.

The following interface signals support this functionality:

PPROT

A protection signal to support both non-secure and secure transactions on APB.

PSTRB

A write strobe signal to enable sparse data transfer on the write data bus.

This version of the specification is referred to as APB4.

Description

Clock source

Clock. The rising edge of PCLK times all transfers on the APB.

PRESETn

Reset. The APB reset signal is active LOW. This signal is normally connected
directly to the system bus reset signal.

APB bridge

PENABLE

PWRITE

APB bridge

PWDATA

APB bridge

PSTRB

APB bridge

Address. This is the APB address bus. It can be up to 32 bits wide and is driven
by the peripheral bus bridge unit.

Protection type. This signal indicates the normal, privileged, or secure
protection level of the transaction and whether the transaction is a data access
or an instruction access.

Select. The APB bridge unit generates this signal to each peripheral bus slave.
It indicates that the slave device is selected and that a data transfer is required.
There is a PSELx signal for each slave.

Enable. This signal indicates the second and subsequent cycles of an APB
transfer.

Direction. This signal indicates an APB write access when HIGH and an APB
read access when LOW.

Write data. This bus is driven by the peripheral bus bridge unit during write
cycles when PWRITE is HIGH. This bus can be up to 32 bits wide.

Write strobes. This signal indicates which byte lanes to update during a write
transfer. There is one write strobe for each eight bits of the write data bus.
Therefore, PSTRB[n] corresponds to PWDATA[(8n + 7):(8n)]. Write
strobes must not be active during a read transfer.

PREADY

Slave interface

Ready. The slave uses this signal to extend an APB transfer.

PRDATA

Slave interface

Read Data. The selected slave drives this bus during read cycles when
PWRITE is LOW. This bus can be up to 32-bits wide.

PSLVERR

Slave interface

This signal indicates a transfer failure. APB peripherals are not required to
support the PSLVERR pin. This is true for both existing and new APB
peripheral designs. Where a peripheral does not include this pin then the
appropriate input to the APB bridge is tied LOW.

2.1.1

Data buses

The APB protocol has two independent data buses, one for read data and one for write data. The
buses can be up to 32 bits wide. Because the buses do not have their own individual handshake
signals, it is not possible for data transfers to occur on both buses at the same time.

Write transfers

This section describes the following types of write transfer:
•
•

With no wait states

Data 1

Figure 3-1 Write transfer with no wait states

At T1, a write transfer starts with address PADDR, write data PWDATA, write signal
PWRITE, and select signal PSEL, being registered at the rising edge of PCLK. This is called
the Setup phase of the write transfer.

At T2, enable signal PENABLE, and ready signal PREADY, are registered at the rising edge
of PCLK.

When asserted, PENABLE indicates the start of the Access phase of the transfer.

When asserted, PREADY indicates that the slave can complete the transfer at the next rising
edge of PCLK.

The address PADDR, write data PWDATA, and control signals all remain valid until the
transfer completes at T3, the end of the Access phase.

The enable signal PENABLE, is deasserted at the end of the transfer. The select signal PSEL,
is also deasserted unless the transfer is to be followed immediately by another transfer to the
same peripheral.

3.1.2 With wait states

Figure 3-2 on page 3-3 shows how the slave can use the PREADY signal to extend the transfer.
During an Access phase, when PENABLE is HIGH, the slave extends the transfer by driving
PREADY LOW. The following signals remain unchanged while PREADY remains LOW:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

address, PADDR
write signal, PWRITE
select signal, PSEL
enable signal, PENABLE
write data, PWDATA
write strobes, PSTRB

PREADY can take any value when PENABLE is LOW. This ensures that peripherals that have
a fixed two cycle access can tie PREADY HIGH.

Note

 It is recommended that the address and write signals are not changed immediately after a
transfer, but remain stable until another access occurs. This reduces power consumption.

3.2

Write strobes

Transfers

The write strobe signals, PSTRB, enable sparse data transfer on the write data bus. Each write
strobe signal corresponds to one byte of the write data bus. When asserted HIGH, a write strobe
indicates that the corresponding byte lane of the write data bus contains valid information.

There is one write strobe for each eight bits of the write data bus, so PSTRB[n] corresponds to
PWDATA[(8n + 7):(8n)]. Figure 3-3 shows this relationship on a 32-bit data bus.

Two types of read transfer are described in this section:
•
•

With wait states.

3.3.1 With no wait states

3.3.2 With wait states

Figure 3-5 shows how the PREADY signal can extend the transfer. The transfer is extended if
PREADY is driven LOW during an Access phase. The protocol ensures that the following
remain unchanged for the additional cycles:
•
•
•
•
•

address, PADDR
write signal, PWRITE
select signal, PSEL
enable signal, PENABLE
protection type, PPROT.

Figure 3-5 shows that two cycles are added using the PREADY signal. However, you can add
any number of additional cycles, from zero upwards.

3.4

Error response

Transfers

You can use PSLVERR to indicate an error condition on an APB transfer. Error conditions can
occur on both read and write transactions.

PSLVERR is only considered valid during the last cycle of an APB transfer, when PSEL,
PENABLE, and PREADY are all HIGH.

It is recommended, but not mandatory, that you drive PSLVERR LOW when it is not being
sampled. That is, when any of PSEL, PENABLE, or PREADY are LOW.

Transactions that receive an error, might or might not have changed the state of the peripheral.
This is peripheral-specific and either is acceptable. When a write transaction receives an error
this does not mean that the register within the peripheral has not been updated. Read transactions
that receive an error can return invalid data. There is no requirement for the peripheral to drive
the data bus to all 0s for a read error.

APB peripherals are not required to support the PSLVERR pin. This is true for both existing
and new APB peripheral designs. Where a peripheral does not include this pin then the
appropriate input to the APB bridge is tied LOW.

Mapping of PSLVERR

When bridging:

Figure 3-7 Example failing read transfer

From AXI to APB  An APB error is mapped back to RRESP/BRESP = SLVERR. This is

achieved by mapping PSLVERR to the AXI signals RRESP[1] for reads
and BRESP[1] for writes.

From AHB to APB  PSLVERR is mapped back to HRESP = ERROR for both reads and

writes. This is achieved by mapping PSLVERR to the AHB signal
HRESP[0].

Protection unit support

Transfers

To support complex system designs, it is often necessary for both the interconnect and other
devices in the system to provide protection against illegal transactions. For the APB interface,
this protection is provided by the PPROT[2:0] signals.

The three levels of access protection are:

Normal or privileged, PPROT[0]

•

•

LOW indicates a normal access

HIGH indicates a privileged access.

This is used by some masters to indicate their processing mode. A privileged
processing mode typically has a greater level of access within a system.

Secure or non-secure, PPROT[1]

LOW indicates a secure access

HIGH indicates a non-secure access.

This is used in systems where a greater degree of differentiation between
processing modes is required.

Note

This bit is configured so that when it is HIGH then the transaction is considered
non-secure and when LOW, the transaction is considered as secure.

Data or Instruction, PPROT[2]

•

LOW indicates a data access

HIGH indicates an instruction access.

This bit gives an indication if the transaction is a data or instruction access.

Note

This indication is provided as a hint and is not accurate in all cases. For example,
where a transaction contains a mix of instruction and data items. It is
recommended that, by default, an access is marked as a data access unless it is
specifically known to be an instruction access.

[2]

1 = privileged access
0 = normal access

1 = nonsecure access
0 = secure access

1 = instruction access
0 = data access

Note

 The primary use of PPROT is as an identifier for Secure or Non-secure transactions. It is
acceptable to use different interpretations of the PPROT[0] and PPROT[2] identifiers.

Operating states

Figure 4-1 shows the operational activity of the APB.

Operating States

No transfer

IDLE
PSELx = 0
PENABLE = 0

Transfer

PREADY = 1
and no
transfer

SETUP
PSELx = 1
PENABLE = 0

PREADY = 1
and transfer

PREADY = 0

ACCESS
PSELx = 1
PENABLE = 1

Figure 4-1 State diagram

The state machine operates through the following states:

IDLE

This is the default state of the APB.

SETUP

When a transfer is required the bus moves into the SETUP state, where the
appropriate select signal, PSELx, is asserted. The bus only remains in the SETUP
state for one clock cycle and always moves to the ACCESS state on the next
rising edge of the clock.

ACCESS

The enable signal, PENABLE, is asserted in the ACCESS state. The address,
write, select, and write data signals must remain stable during the transition from
the SETUP to ACCESS state.

Exit from the ACCESS state is controlled by the PREADY signal from the slave:
If PREADY is held LOW by the slave then the peripheral bus remains in
•
the ACCESS state.
If PREADY is driven HIGH by the slave then the ACCESS state is exited
and the bus returns to the IDLE state if no more transfers are required.
Alternatively, the bus moves directly to the SETUP state if another transfer
follows.
